# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to help our company prepare for the "silver tsunami" (mass retirment of our employees) and see what manaagers need to start preparring for. Some of the department heads also wanted us to look closley at their respective departmetns so that they can see who is eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
We have some conclusions we can come to about the "silver tsunami" about to happen at our company.

### 1. Senior titles has vastly more people then other titles.
The seniour titles such as Seniour Engineer, and Senior Staff have almost 3 times more people retiring then the regular Engineers and Staff. 

### 2. Entry level postions will have issues.
The assistant engineeer which is a entry level postion will only see 1,000 emplyoees retire. This wont impact our operations much, but we will need to look into some hiring strategys for entry level positons as higher level titles will be retiring, and we wil most likely be promoting internally to fill higher positions.since we will most likely be filling the seniour positions with the employees at lower positions in the company. This also means our regular Engineers and Staff will be heavily effected and we will need to focus our hiring efforts in that spot while we promote people to the seniour positions.

### 3. Manageers dont have any people eligible to mentor.
As seen in this table, (this count is from the mentorship_eligibility table) and we have no managers eligible to mentor the next group of managers that need to fill the 2 retiring positions. 

### 4. We lack alot of mentors for each title.
Each title has about 2% of the total "silver tsunami" retiring wave eligable to mentor. we may need to look into broadening our requirments for menotrs so that we can get more that are eligible.
